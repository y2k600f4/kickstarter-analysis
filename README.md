# Kickstarter-analysis (Kickstarting with Excel)

##Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze a Kickstarter crowdfunding dataset to determine how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 

##Analysis and Challenges

The analysis was performed by generating two charts with corresponding graphs based on the data of interest contained within the crowdfunding dataset. The first chart/graph was created by generating a pivot table and graph in excel to visualize campaign outcomes based on the launch date.  The second chart/graph was created by first generating a table to calculate outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) based on goals and representing them as percentages. The goals were broken down into twelve ranges between the values of less than $1,000 to over $50,000. A pivot table and graph were then generated to visualize outcomes (percentage) based on the specific goal. 

###Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One challenge during the analysis was properly generating the correct pivot table format to show proper formatting of “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date”.  Placing the appropriate pivot table fields in the columns, rows and values is needed to generate the proper table and graph. The difficulty was overcome by experimenting and learning more about how the column, row and value field effect the pivot table and associated graph.

##Results

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

One conclusion that can be drawn between the Theater Outcomes by Launch date are that a May launch date leads to the most successful theater outcome (111).  Another conclusion that can be drawn is that theater outcomes have the most failed campaigns when launched in July and October (50) with a June being very close (49). 

###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Analysis of the Theatre outcomes based on goals show that goals greater than $45,000 clearly show the highest failure rate and lowest success rate.

###Summary

The goal of analyzing different campaigns and how they fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals was limited to the the Kickstarter crowdfunding dataset. The dataset contains a sampling over various countries, categories and launch dates. To obtain a more accurate analysis a dataset that concentrates more on an area of interest (specific country, category etc.) and within a narrower launch date (with larger data sample size) would produce a more accurate analysis on predicting how a specific campaign would fare in relation to launch date and funding goals.
Recommended additional table and graphs to further compare launch dates and funding goals is to update both the “Theatre Outcomes By Launch Date” and “Outcomes Based on Goal” tables and graphs to compare all the subcategories of theatre (Plays, musical and spaces). The current analysis shows the combined subcategories of Plays, Musicals and Spaces for “Theatre outcomes by launch date” while  ”Outcomes based on Goals” analysis shows data for the subcategory of plays only.
